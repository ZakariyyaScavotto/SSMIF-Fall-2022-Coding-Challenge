STATISTICS METHOD OUTPUT:
Displaying Graphs to Visualize Distribution

To test for a significant difference in mean daily returns, I used a modification of a student's t-test Welch's t-test. To perform this test, I am assuming that the observations in each sample are:
Normally distributed (confirmed looking at histograms). Note: for a student's t-test, there is an assumption of equal variance between the two grooups, but this assumption is not the case in Welch's t-test, meaning that the only assumption is the normal distribution assumption.

p-value:  0.5252563174852881

result: because the p-value is greater than the significance level of 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, meaning that there is 
no statistically significant difference between the mean daily returns of the two equities.

To test for a significant difference in volatilities, I used a f-test. To perform this test, I am assuming that the observations in each 
sample are:
Normally distributed (confirmed looking at histograms) and are independent events (Coke is a beverage company, while Tesla is a car company, one does not have a direct impact on the other).

p-value:  1.1102230246251565e-16

result: because the p-value is less than the significance level of 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis, meaning that there is a statistically significant difference between the volatilities of the two equities.
